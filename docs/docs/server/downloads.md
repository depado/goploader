# Downloads

All downloads can be found on the 
[releases](https://github.com/depado/goploader/releases) page on GitHub. This
page exists to explain the different download types.

## Standalone Downloads

The standalone distribution contains only a binary. All assets and templates 
(html files, css, js, etc) are included directly in the binary. If you don't 
intend to modify those assets, this distribution is for you. All you have to
do is download the archive, and go the [Setup](install.md) page to read
the instructions on how to setup goploader server.

## Simple Downloads

These downloads contain the pre-compiled binary along with all its assets.
You're free to modify what you want in those assets. (HTML templates, CSS, JS)
