## Introduction

Goploader's ultimate goal is to make file sharing easy and painless. This project is composed of a server and a client, both written in Go. The main things to remember about the project are :
 - Sharing stuff from your terminal should be easy
 - Sharing stuff without a terminal should be easy
 - Privacy matters

## Build from source

Make sure you have go installed on your machine.

### Client

$ git clone https://github.com/depado/goploader.git
$ cd goploader
$ go build -o gpldr ./client/
```

### Server

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/depado/goploader.git
$ cd goploader
$ go build -o goploader-server ./server/
