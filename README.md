## Introduction

Goploader's ultimate goal is to make file sharing easy and painless. This project is composed of a server and a client, both written in Go. The main things to remember about the project are :
 - Sharing stuff from your terminal should be easy
 - Sharing stuff without a terminal should be easy
 - Privacy matters

## Build from source

Make sure you have Go installed on your machine.

### Client

```shell
$ go get github.com/Depado/goploader/client
$ go build -o $GOPATH/bin/goploader github.com/Depado/goploader/client
```

### Server

```shell
$ # Move to a new directory that will be used to run the server
$ go get github.com/Depado/goploader/server
$ # The following steps are optional
$ # Execute those if you wish to embed the assets and templates into the binary
$ go get github.com/GeertJohan/go.rice/rice
$ rice embed-go -i=github.com/Depado/goploader/server
$ # End of the optional steps
$ go build github.com/Depado/goploader/server
$ # If you did not embed the resources, make sure to copy the assets and templates directories
$ cp -r $GOPATH/src/github.com/Depado/goploader/server/{assets,templates} .
$ # Execute the binary a first time to trigger the setup
$ # Or write your own conf.yml file
$ ./server
```

## Downloads

## Documentation

All the documentation is available at [gpldr.in](https://docs.gpldr.in). I intend to write a proper `README.md` file, but it takes a lot of work to transpose the existing documentation to the markdown format. So, work in progress.
